## Gaussian Smooth Settings
The **Gaussian Smooth Settings** window allows you to configure a smoothing filter that can be used to reduce high-frequency noise in your data. This is a common preprocessing step that can improve the quality of your chromatograms, making it easier to detect and resolve peaks. The filter works by applying a Gaussian function to the data, effectively averaging out sudden changes and creating a smoother curve.
### How to Use
- **Window size (odd number)**: This value specifies the size of the smoothing window. The window must be an odd number. A larger window size will result in more aggressive smoothing, which can be useful for removing significant noise but may also cause a loss of resolution for sharp peaks.
- **Sigma (Ïƒ)**: This value controls the standard deviation of the Gaussian curve. Sigma determines the spread of the smoothing function. A larger sigma value will increase the smoothing effect, while a smaller value will make it more localized.
After adjusting the settings to your preference, click **OK** to apply the changes and proceed, or **Cancel** to exit without making any changes.

## Moving Average Smooth Settings
The **Moving Average Smooth Settings** window allows you to configure a simple but effective smoothing filter. This method reduces noise by calculating the average of a specified number of data points within a defined window and then replacing the central point with that average. This process is repeated across the entire chromatogram, resulting in a smoother curve that is easier to analyze.
### How to Use
- **Window size (odd number)**: This value defines the number of data points to include in the moving average calculation. You must enter an odd number. A larger window size will increase the smoothing effect, which can be useful for removing significant noise but may also blur sharp peaks.
