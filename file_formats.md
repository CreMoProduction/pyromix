# Supported File Formats
Pyromix is designed to work with a standardized and open file format to ensure compatibility across a wide range of analytical instruments and software packages. 

?> The program accepts GC-MS AIA-standard `netCDF` files.

To be recognized by Pyromix, these files must have the `.cdf` extension. 

!> It is also important that all your samples have the same mass range size and retention time length. While Pyromix will prompt you to correct any inconsistencies upon import, it is highly recommended to ensure all your data files are uniform from the start for the most reliable processing.
