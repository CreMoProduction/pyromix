# Project settings
Project data management is designed to be intuitive and hassle-free. When you open .cdf files and start processing for an unsaved project, Pyromix automatically stores your data and settings in a default location: `C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Pyromix`. This means you don't need to manually save your work every time; upon reopening the program, it will automatically resume from where you left off. While this default location is convenient, it can only handle one unsaved project at a time. For better organization and to work on multiple projects, you can move your project data to a specified folder of your choice. Pyromix allows you to easily manage and switch between several recently opened projects, and all changes are automatically saved when you close the project. 
## Usage
To save a project to a specified folder, go to `File > Save Project`. To open a previously saved project, select `File > Open project`. Additionally, Pyromix keeps track of your most recently accessed projects, which you can quickly open by navigating to `File > Open recent`.
